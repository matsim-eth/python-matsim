# Hack to delay evaluation of "find packages" to after code was generated.
# Our issue here is that there a a lot of generated packages, and in the long run we want those to be influenced
# by command line options (for instance adding jars).
# Caveat: this actually depends on implementation details of `setup` and might break with changes in them
# (for instance if list of packages gets cached in a new list)
